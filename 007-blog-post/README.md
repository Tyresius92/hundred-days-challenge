### Learning Goals

Focus on the visual representation of the blog post.

20 Minutes

### Biggest hurdles

None, really. This was another not very helpful project. Balancing coding outside of work with life is hard, man.

### What I learned

I need to find some way to balance getting better at coding with spending time with my loved ones.

### Links Used

None.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I may not have finished this before midnight, but I did finish watching Lord of the Rings with my significant other and roommates.
