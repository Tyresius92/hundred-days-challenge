# Bowling Game

Implement a class which represents and scores a game of bowling.

### Idea Source

Based on Uncle Bob's TDD demo, so I naturally used TDD when developing this. That said, he usually ignores input validation and other edge cases. Here, I've extended it to account for these cases.

### Learning Goals

Do some TDD, yo.

### Time spent

About an hour

### Biggest hurdles

I had some trouble figuring out how to handle the "first ball is 5, second ball is 7" error case.

### What I learned

There's a reason he skips that junk in the demo.

### Links Used

None

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I extended something I saw on the internet and made it my own!
