# React Modal

This project builds out a Modal component in React.

### Idea Source

My head, as well as most React design systems.

### Learning Goals

How to build a modal, mainly. It would be cool to have my own custom one.

### Time spent

30 minutes

### Biggest hurdles

Getting the styling right was hard.

### What I learned

Much of the magic happens in the Mcss file. I would have prefrred to do it with vanilla js, but I guess base componentes liike this one do require some custom CSS sometimes.

### Links Used

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude
