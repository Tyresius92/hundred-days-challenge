# Calculator

Build a Calculator in React.

### Idea Source

I saw this suggestion in a couple of places, but it's not terribly original.

### Learning Goals

There are a couple of tricky problems I foresee here, but mainly this is just a general problem solving kind of project.

### Time spent

About 90 minutes.

### Biggest hurdles

There were several times when I thought I was done, and then found a case where I was, in fact, not done. There still might be edge cases that are not covered, but I think I have all the major calculator usages covered.

Additionally, I probably should have done more (or any) testing, because there is a fair amount of room for error here.

Finally, I straight up didn't have time to do any styling, but it would be fairly easy to add some styling to this and make it pretty.

### What I learned

A calculator is not as simple as I first presumed. Also, refactoring and extracting helper functions is super helpful.

### Links Used

None.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I did manage to build a calculator fairly quickly!
