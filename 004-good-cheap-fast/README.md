# Good Fast Cheap

This is a simple jokey application that tells you that you can have a project with 2 out of 3: Good, Fast, or Cheap.

### Idea Source

[FlorinPop's Hundred Days Challenge, Day 99](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/full/QWwgyXd)

### Learning Goals

A bit of CSS, plus it would be nice to create a really nicely styled Toggle component.

### Time spent

About an hour.

### Biggest hurdles

Oof. Speed coding. This was a busy day, so I intentionally picked something I thought I could knock out quickly. And I did! However, I found it personally challenging not to spend a ton of time doing a bunch of research on A11y for something that is ultimately supposed to be quick and dirty.

### What I learned

Given the hurdle described above, it also made me realize how much I've been relying on my company's design system to handle A11y for me. This is definitely something that I want to do more research on and generally be more knowledgeable about.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I got to use my new CRA-Wrapper from yesterday! Also realized I don't actually need to make it a global if I just specify the path in full (i.e. ../../path/to/final/location/name-of-app)
