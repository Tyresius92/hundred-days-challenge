# Counter

This is an absurdly simple application that counts up and down, and has a reset button.

### Idea Source

[drminnaar's react-clicker application](https://github.com/drminnaar/react-clicker)

### Learning Goals

A bit of CSS, but mainly, this is a "gotta be consistent" project.

### Time spent

20 minutes

### Biggest hurdles

None, really. I had a pretty simple design in mind for the React part. Most of the time was spent on making the styling look nice. I didn't even have to do any Googling.

### What I learned

Coding quickly can be quite fun! Especially if you pick something super simple. That said, I think I'm going to avoid doing things this simple in the future. I didn't really learn anything, it was mostly just practicing and/or regurgitating what I already know. Was a nice ego boost, but that's about it.

### Links Used

None today!

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I did knock this out in about 20 minutes, which feels pretty nice.
