# create-apollo-server

A shell script that will bootstrap a new Apollo Server and add my specific configuration preferences.

Since I intend to use this a fair amount, it has been placed in a separate repo: https://github.com/Tyresius92/create-apollo-server

### Idea Source

My Head, by way of Day 3

### Learning Goals

None, really. Mainly just trying to save myself some time, at least while I'm doing a new project every day.

### Time spent

1.5 hours

### Biggest hurdles

Ran into some funkiness where I pulled in the checkPrettier script from the wrong place.

### What I learned

Copy Paste is dangerous, yo.

### Links Used

None

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I never have to bootstrap an Apollo Server again.
