# Minesweeper

This is a pretty simple Minesweeper clone. It doesn't have some of the niceties (like auto expanding a region of zeros) but it gets the job done.

### Idea Source

My Head

### Learning Goals

Get more practice with 2D arrays, because I always need that.

### Time spent

2 Hours.

### Biggest hurdles

Honestly, most of that two hours was debugging stupid, "wait, is this a row or a column" errors.

### What I learned

Sometimes, you only want to test the public interface of your system. Other times, it's super helpful to test those internal pieces.

### Links Used

None

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I did manage to get a working game! Even if it took a beat.
