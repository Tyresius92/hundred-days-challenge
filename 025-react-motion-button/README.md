# React Motion Demo

Not doing much here, just wanted to play a little bit with the React Motion library, and I didn't have a ton of time.

### Idea Source

### What I learned

React Motion doesn't handle much of the styling for you, but it _does_ handle all of the re-renders of the intermediate steps.
