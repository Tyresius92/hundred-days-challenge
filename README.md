# ~Hundred~ Fifty Days of Code

This repo is a collection of ~100~ 50 small projects, intended to keep the habit going and learn new stuff.

UPDATE: I'm hella tired man. I might pick this up again, but I need a break. I've done 50 days at this point, which is, frankly, a hell of a lot to do in a row. My brain is tired of coming up with ideas, and I really just want to sink my teeth into a larger project than this framework really allows. I'm probably going to start work on Budgetize Me again, or there's another idea I've got rolling around in my head that I might start on.

### Potential project ideas

- [FlorinPop's 100 Days Challenge](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/full/VwYWMOa)
- ~~Dice roller~~
- ~~A bash script that runs Create-React-App then does my custom configuration~~
- A Text component that can be reused throughout an App (possible extension: heading, subheading, and section title components)
- Chess board
- Deck of Cards UI
- Calculator
- 2048 Clone with animations
- Scroll-text thing like on [this site](https://www.fdaviz.com/)
- Use puppeteer (scrape some websites)
- Use jscodeshift to reorganize some files
- Use 11ty
- Write a node script that uses babel ast to find all files using some js construct
