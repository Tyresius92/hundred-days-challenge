# Hundred Days of Code

This repo is a collection of 100 small projects, intended to keep the habit going and learn new stuff.

### Potential project ideas

-   [FlorinPop's 100 Days Challenge](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/full/VwYWMOa)
-   Dice roller
-   A bash script that runs Create-React-App then does my custom configuration
-   A Text component that can be reused throughout an App (possible extension: heading, subheading, and section title components)
