# create-react-app Wrapper

I have a particular way that I like my React Applications to be structured (including eslint config, and so on). The idea here is to take the latest create-react-app output and add additional configuration on top of it.

Since this is something I intend to reuse, I've placed it in its own repo here: https://github.com/Tyresius92/cra-wrapper

### Idea Source

My head.

### Learning Goals

Learn some bash. Today actually has an output goal though, which is a reusable tool that I can use when making a new React Application.

### Time spent

2 hours

### Biggest hurdles

I'm not terribly familiar with bash, so doing that research was time consuming.

Additionally, just running CRA so many times is quite time consuming.

### What I learned

This was a lot easier than expected! I don't know why I didn't do this before. :P

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I don't have to do that boilerplate configuration EVER AGAIN!
