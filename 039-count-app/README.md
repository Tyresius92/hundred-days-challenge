# Count App

This is a simple counting application that allows the user to see how many times a pgge has been loaded, as well as how many times a button has been clicked. I wanted an excuse to play around with Chakra a bit more, as we've decided to move forward with that library in a separate project.

### Idea Source

FlorinPop built [something similar](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/BayQZZy) during their hundred days challenge.

### Learning Goals

Play around with a new API. Build some simple components. Almost kata-esque at this point.

### Time spent

### Biggest hurdles

### What I learned

### Links Used

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude
