# Numbers

Create a set of LCD Numbers out of blocks which are either on or off.

### Idea Source

https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas/tree/master/src#lcd-digits-

### Learning Goals

Abstraction practice. Also, just a kind of interesting challenge.

### Time spent

1 hour

### Biggest hurdles

Ran into a bit of a struggle trying to not use the array index as the key in Number.js. Had to do a bit of research to figure out how to do that.

### What I learned

You can generate an ID on the fly to be used as the key. Simple solution, if a little bit less than ideal.

### Links Used

[Don't use array indices as keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46735483/error-do-not-use-array-index-in-keys)

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I learned a neat trick! And I actually pulled this off in about an hour!
