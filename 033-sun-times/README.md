# Sun Times

Take in a location, return the times of sunrise and sunset.

### Idea Source

My partner's head.

### Learning Goals

Combine some APIs, practice with dates

### Time spent

About an hour

### Biggest hurdles

Getting the dates into localized timezones was trickier than I expected.

### What I learned

Don't be afraid to rely on libraries. Also, DON'T store secrets in the client `.env` file. Totally thought that was safe before. So that was a good lesson.
