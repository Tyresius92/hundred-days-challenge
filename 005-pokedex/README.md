# Pokedex

This directory contains a React application that presents pokemon data in a variety of configurations. On future days, I might use this idea as a basis for several other projects. For instance, building out a pokedex that uses graphql for data fetching, or using it to learn TypeScript. For today, just get the MVP up and running.

### Idea Source

[FlorinPop's Pokedex](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/gOYZxyE)

### Learning Goals

Images and CSS! Build out something that looks nice.

### Time spent

2 Hours

### Biggest hurdles

Some of the CSS was tricky. Trying to write the Material UI classes in a way that was reusable turned out harder than expected. The Type labels still didn't quite end up the way I wanted them - I'd like the labels to use a darker color than the base card, but I had already reached the time box.

### What I learned

However, this was a simple enough project that I think it would make a lot of sense to do this again in TypeScript to get some experience with it. Could also try and build it in Vue.js or something. Could be fun.

Also learned a pretty neat trick to have circle backgrounds for images with transparent backgrounds. That was cool.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

Pokemon was super fun! And I found a super simple project to try out a bunch of different stuff with!
