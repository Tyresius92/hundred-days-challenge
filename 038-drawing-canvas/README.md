# Drawing Canvas

This project is a simple canvas whih allows the user to draw lines, similar to MS Paint. It only handles single lines, and does not have any fancy features, such as fill area, or changing colors.

### Idea Source

My head.

### Learning Goals

HTML Canvases? Probably? In general, how do you take this kind of input in?

### Time spent

About an hour

### Biggest hurdles

I was quite out of my depth on this one. I ended up loosely following a tutorial to learn about this junk.

### What I learned

There's a reasonable amount that goes into drawing a canvas like this, but ultimately, it's not terribly hard. Already thinking ahead, it doesn't seem like a huge lift to add color support as well as other fun features like fill area and whatnot.

### Links Used

NB: The folks who wrote this article are using some straight up antipatterns here (modifying state directly, for instance), but the bones of my implementation came from here.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I was _really_ nervous about this one, but it ended up being not too bad! Yay!
