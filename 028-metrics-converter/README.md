# Metrics Converter

This is a simple app that allows you to convert between different units (yards to miles, for instance).

### Idea Source

My Head

### Learning Goals

Build out a system that avoided repetitious code as much as possible.

### Time spent

1 hour

### Biggest hurdles

I definitely started off by writing a function for each possible conversion. But then I remembered how you convert from base 3 to base 7 (by way of base 10), and I realized that by always converting via a pass through, such as inches, I could dramatically simplify the code.

I would be interested in continuing this project and adding metric units to the system as well.

### What I learned

Once you find yourself repeating code, abstract more.

### Links Used

None

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I'm almost a third done with this thing!
