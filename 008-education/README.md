# Education Data

Not coming into this project with a well defined idea. Mainly just going to play around with the government data API and see what comes out the other side.

Update: This data would be structured so much better as a graphql server. Let's see what we can do.

### Idea Source

Found this page with a list of government APIs: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#government

Thought I'd play around with the education one, since I enjoy education.

### Learning Goals

Take an API and make something vaguely interesting.

Update: Gonna build my first real deal graph server.

### Time spent

3 hours.

### Biggest hurdles

Wrapping my head around how to properly structure my requests to make sure I don't make 1000 calls to the gov API was a little tricky. I also felt myself getting sucked into the "but what's the _best_ way to do this" rabbit hole, but I recognized it and shut that down.

### What I learned

Building out a graph server is not as hard as I previously thought, although I definitely think this one could be better.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

Mainly the shutting down the "best way" rabbit hole I felt myself falling into. Once I actually started coding, the best way just kind of naturally came up. That was nice to see.
