# Birthday Bean

One of my music teachers once told me that you're not really a musician until you've played "Happy Birthday" for someone. Well, today, I become a coder for real.

Today is my partner's birthday, so this project is two-fold. Part 1 is to build a nice page to say Happy Birthday to her (Name explanation: We call each other "Bean", because we're adorable). Part 2 is to create a nice `<Image />` component that gives you some styling options.

EDIT: Due to privacy concerns, my partner has requested that today's project be made private, so no code has been added.

### Idea Source

My head.

### Learning Goals

Create a re-usable Image component. (Eventually, I might look into turning the Image component into an npm package or something. We shall see.)

### Time spent

1 Hour

### Biggest hurdles

I didn't get the Image component to quite where I wanted it - it doesn't add a _ton_ of value over and above a normal <img /> tag. I may revisit the concept at some point, but for now it's not totally worth sharing.

### What I learned

Designing a useful component is harder than it appears at first pass - In order to make it generic enough to use outside of a specific project, it's difficult to add much value beyond a normal html tag.

### Links Used

None.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

My partner loved the thing!
