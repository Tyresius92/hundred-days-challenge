# Learn Vue

This project is just some dedicated time to sit down and read up on Vue - how it works, what the deal is, and build out a small project using it.

### Idea Source

Eh...It's not really an idea, so much as just like, I'mma learn a thing?

### Learning Goals

Gain some basic familiarity with Vue.

### Time spent

1.5 hours

### Biggest hurdles

Welp. It turns out I have no interest in Vue. I just have rather strong disagreements with the basic underlying design philosophy.

### What I learned

Well, I read the docs, and I played with some code, rendering some lists and whatnot, and then I noped out pretty hard. One of my earliest web dev experiences was using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), which is basically what it sounds like, taking your JS, and embedding it into your HTML. I found it unintuitive, hard to refactor, and WAY too easy to make elements that were just too large. Turns out that after almost two years working in software engineering, that initial reaction holds true.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I feel as though I'm capable of making decisions about software and trusting that judgment. That said, I _should_ still do some work in the Vue ecosystem, just to keep myself fresh.
