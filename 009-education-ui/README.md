# Education Website UI

This project is just a simple UI to display data from yesterday's Apollo Server project.

### Idea Source

My Head, via Day 8.

### Learning Goals

Play around with Apollo Client, in particular the useQuery hook.

### Time spent

1.5 Hours

### Biggest hurdles

Reading through the docs for Apollo and also for Ant Design.

### What I learned

I got to play with both Apollo Client and Ant Design, which was super fun. I quite like the Ant Design system, even if I didn't quite figure out how the Less styling system worked.

Possible Extensions: I didn't get around to making the component to display data for a single school. That's definitely the next step for this.

### Links Used

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I built a thing that uses Apollo Client! It's not the first time I've done it, but it is the first time I've actually done it reasonably well.
