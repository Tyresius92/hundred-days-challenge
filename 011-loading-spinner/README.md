# Loading Spinner

This is a custom Loading Spinner component that can be used while data is being fetched. It should have options to change the color, add description text, and, if time allows, to change the icon that's used.

### Idea Source

My head.

### Learning Goals

Play with some CSS animations. Also just in general wanted a really simple one off component that would have some uses in other, larger, projects.

### Time spent

2 hours

### Biggest hurdles

Man, those CSS transitions were harder than I thought they would be. But I learned a lot about them! I bet next time I try to do something like this it will go a lot faster.

### What I learned

As I said, I learned a TON about CSS transitions. Given more time, it would be dope to make this a bit fancier.

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I was really nervous about this one! I thought it would be hard, and it was, but I totally did the thing in less time than I expected!
