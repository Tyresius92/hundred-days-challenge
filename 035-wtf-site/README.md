# WTF Site

An obscenity ridden site that randomly generates an obscenity riddled suggestion for what you should do during quarantine.

I decided to actually buy a domain and post this sucker, so the standalone repo is here: https://github.com/Tyresius92/wtf-site

Additionally, the live website is here: https://whatthefuckdoidoinquarantine.com/

### Idea Source

I remember seeing [this one](http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/) a few years back, and figured I'd build my own. (They've used a generator tool for that one, but why wouldn't I build it from scratch?)

### Learning Goals

Randomization! Template strings! At this point I'm just kind of combining things I know to make something cool.

### Time spent

1 hour

### Biggest hurdles

It was a little tricky generating some of the nested strings at randomization time.

### What I learned

if you initialize an array that contains an IIFE, the IIFE is only run once.

### Links Used

None

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude
