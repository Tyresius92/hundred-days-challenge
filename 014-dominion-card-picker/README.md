# Dominion Card Picker

I've been playing a fair amount of Dominion online at [dominion.games](https://dominion.games), but the card selection process is not super ideal. In particular, sometimes I want to play a game that has some thematic bit to it, such as all Duration cards, or all Attack cards, but the UI does not make it easy to pull this off.

This is a simple card picker that picks 10 random cards based on the type of card, or just gives 10 random cards if no filter is selected.

### Idea Source

My head.

### Learning Goals

Really I just wanted this tool.

### Time spent

1.5 hours

### Biggest hurdles

There were a LOT more card types than I expected - I need to break things down into smaller pieces, I think. I didn't have time to make it only select certain types of cards, or to do the styling that I wanted.

### What I learned

Budget more time than I thought.

### Links Used

-   [Dominion Card API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5603098/RWguxcDR?version=latest)
-   [Adding a font to a CRA app](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52381240/fully-include-google-web-font-in-create-react-app-build-without-ejecting)

### Thing to Celebrate / Moment of Gratitude

I now have the utter MVP of this project laid out! This is very much a tool I want, because picking thematic games is hard. Now I just need to add the filtering capabilities, but that's a tomorrow/later thing. (Actually, this may be a "build it again during the challenge" type of project. We'll see.)
