# Dominion Card Picker

I've been playing a fair amount of Dominion online at [dominion.games](https://dominion.games), but the card selection process is not super ideal. In particular, sometimes I want to play a game that has some thematic bit to it, such as all Duration cards, or all Attack cards, but the UI does not make it easy to pull this off. 

This is a simple card picker that picks 10 random cards based on the type of card, or just gives 10 random cards if no filter is selected.
