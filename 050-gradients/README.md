# Gradients

This project is a simple form where you can put in an RGB color code, and get back a gradient - a color pallet which gives different shades of that color. 

### Idea Source

Various tools online, but I was just interested in some of that color theory stuff. 

### Learning Goals

How do these pallets get generated? What is the color theory behind it.

### Time spent

2 hours

### Biggest hurdles

Man, some of that math gets cuh-RAZY. 

### What I learned

There's a lot of math that determines how the colors work.
